Squash the bug
===========

Squash the bug, if you can.

This is my first JAVA program. Completed in 3 hours:
30 minutes: Download & install Java SE and NetBeans
30 minutes: Open, review, play with samples within NetBeans
30 minutes: Follow the NetBeans GUI tutorial: https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/gui-functionality.html
30 minutes: Complete the functionality to make the button and label functional.
60 minutes: Find & process images, create programming to insert the images as the icon of the button (swapping them out was a beast - only because it took me a while before I realized I didn't have the correct path to the file).

And Viola! I have my first Java program.

Now, just to figure out how to compile it into an executable...
